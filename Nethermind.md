# Fission — Nethermind Track

This **Nethermind-focused** README highlights how **Fission** leverages AI Agents to interact meaningfully with Ethereum (and EVM-compatible chains), aligning with Nethermind’s **“Create Your Agentic Future”** challenge. Fission is an AI-driven governance and automation framework that deploys **autonomous agents** to interpret on-chain data, integrate external signals, and execute secure transactions—all in a **modular**, **scalable** way.

---

## Overview

Fission introduces an **AI Decision Agent** that can:

1. **Analyze On-Chain Data & Transactions**
    - Leverage Ethereum node services, oracles, and Nethermind tooling to parse events and contract states.
2. **Execute Autonomous Actions**
    - From placing trades to performing yield strategies or governance votes, Fission supports robust, secure transaction flows.
3. **Reason & Decide**
    - Incorporate AI-based retrieval, LLM reasoning, and optional futarchy signals to adapt decisions based on real-world conditions or user-defined rules.

We combine these capabilities to demonstrate novel ways AI and blockchain can converge for **DeFAI** (autonomous DeFi strategies), **Agentic Information Retrieval** (intelligent data extraction and processing), and beyond.

---

## Nethermind Track Requirements

1. **At Least One AI Component**
    - Fission’s core is a large language model (LLM) agent that interprets instructions, analyzes data, and reasons about the best on-chain actions to take.
2. **Meaningful Interaction with Ethereum**
    - The agent can query Ethereum/EVM-compatible smart contracts, retrieve logs, track user balances or yield strategies, and autonomously execute transactions.
3. **End-to-End Functionality**
    - Our demonstration includes a fully-functional workflow: from reading on-chain data to making an informed decision (e.g., whether to buy, stake, or vote) and pushing a transaction on a test network (or mainnet in advanced setups).

## Possible Directions with Fission

### 1. DeFAI (Autonomous DeFi Strategies)

- **Yield Optimization**: The AI detects yield farming opportunities across multiple protocols, compares returns, and allocates funds automatically.
- **Advanced Trading Logic**: LLM-based signals plus on-chain analytics feed into a strategy that places trades on DEXs, adjusting for risk and liquidity.

### 2. Agentic Information Retrieval

- **Semantic On-Chain Data Extraction**: The agent uses LLM embedding and indexing to interpret transaction patterns, DAO proposals, or NFT event logs, surfacing insights in human-readable summaries.
- **Automated Auditing**: The agent can scan contract interactions or transaction histories for anomalies, mapping findings back to LLM-based reasoning for transparency.

### 3. Governance & Decision Agents

- **DAO Proposal Summaries**: The agent parses proposals, weighs potential outcomes, and casts votes on behalf of delegated token holders.
- **Futarchy Integration**: Predictive markets or price feeds can shape final decisions, bridging economic signals with LLM logic to power more data-driven, transparent governance.

## How Fission Aligns with Nethermind’s Challenge

| Criterion | Fission’s Approach |
| --- | --- |
| **Innovation (30%)** | We introduce a multi-layered AI agent that merges LLM reasoning with on-chain events and optional prediction markets. This allows for **novel** autonomous decision flows and cross-protocol synergy. |
| **Implementation Quality (25%)** | Our codebase demonstrates a complete **end-to-end** workflow: from analyzing data to executing EVM transactions. We use robust tooling (e.g., **Hardhat**, **Foundry**, **Ethers.js**) and advanced LLM evaluation (G-Eval). |
| **Experimentation Value (15%)** | We document how our agent evolves, iterating on prompt engineering, futarchy signals, and system design. Our approach encourages community feedback and broad exploration of agentic systems. |
| **AI Integration Creativity (15%)** | We combine **language-based reasoning** with on-chain signals, bridging intangible (text) and tangible (smart contract states) information in real-time, forging a genuinely “agentic” loop. |
| **Interface Design (15%)** | Fission offers both a straightforward CLI for advanced users and a web-based UI for broader accessibility, accompanied by logging that explains AI decisions for clarity. |

## Technical Stack

- **LLM Core**
    - LLM based AI Agent Engineering for text interpretation, decision logic, and chain-of-thought transparency.
- **Ethereum Tooling**
    - **Hardhat / Foundry** for testing and deployment, ensuring reliable on-chain operations.
    - **Ethers.js** for web3 transactions and event monitoring.
- **Oracles & Feeds**
    - Integration with oracles (e.g., Chainlink) or custom data feeds for real-world or market data.
    - (Optional) Predictive market data for a futarchy-like approach.
- **Security & Auth**
    - Smart contract permissioning ensures only a validated AI agent can trigger certain high-stakes actions.
    - On-chain or off-chain verification of agent identity.

## Showcase & Demo

1. **Scenario**: A user delegates 100 tokens to the Fission AI for yield-farming decisions.
2. **On-Chain Data Retrieval**: The agent checks liquidity pool stats, interest rates, and user balances.
3. **AI Reasoning**: Fission weighs potential yields vs. historical performance, along with predicted volatility.
4. **Transaction Execution**: If the agent’s confidence threshold is met, it executes a deposit or stake transaction in a target DeFi protocol.
5. **Transparency & Log**: The chain-of-thought (reasoning trace) is logged and auditable, helping the user or community see **why** it made that move.

A concise demo video outlines the entire flow, from **agent initialization** to **transaction confirmation** on an Ethereum testnet.
