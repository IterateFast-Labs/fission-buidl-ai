# Fission — NEAR Track

This **NEAR-specific** README outlines how **Fission** integrates with the [NEAR AI Agent Network](https://app.near.ai/agents), meeting the requirements and goals of the **NEAR track**. Fission is an AI-driven governance and automation platform that leverages large language models, futarchy-based signals, and specialized on-chain mechanisms to bring **transparent, efficient, and autonomous** decision-making to decentralized ecosystems.

---

## Overview

Fission’s **AI Decision Agent** is capable of parsing, summarizing, and autonomously executing tasks or governance actions across multiple blockchains. By **deploying our agent to the NEAR AI Agent Hub**, we unlock the potential for:

1. **Intelligent Data Analysis**: The agent can gather on-chain/off-chain data, generate insights, and produce user-friendly reports.
2. **Knowledge Management**: The agent integrates with NEAR’s ecosystem data, organizes relevant information, and continuously improves its repository of references.
3. **Tool Integration & Execution**: The agent securely interacts with external protocols or on-chain contracts, automating complex workflows on NEAR.

## NEAR AI Agent Network Integration

Fission’s agent is hosted on the [**NEAR Agent Hub**](https://app.near.ai/agents), complying with the NEAR track’s technical requirement. Key features:

1. **Natural Language Processing**
    - Our Large Language Model (LLM) pipeline interprets tasks or governance proposals in natural language, retrieving relevant data from NEAR-based sources.
2. **NEAR-Specific Tools**
    - The agent integrates with NEAR tooling (indexers, oracles, and other contract calls) for data retrieval and on-chain actions.
3. **Autonomous Agent Workflow**
    - Once deployed, the agent can operate independently, collecting data, analyzing it, and triggering relevant transactions or updates on NEAR smart contracts.
4. **Privacy & Data Ownership**
    - We adhere to user-defined permissions on what data can be processed, ensuring compliance with NEAR’s emphasis on user privacy.
5. Simple but Effective AI agents
    - Uploading the beta personas of the AI models implemented in this project to the Near environment, we directly demonstrate that efficient AI agents embody Near’s spirit of being user-friendly and simple to use.

## NEAR Track Requirements

Below is a quick mapping of how Fission meets each **NEAR AI track** requirement:

1. **Agent Hosted on NEAR Agent Hub**
    - Deployed to [NEAR AI Agent Hub](https://app.near.ai/agents), accessible for demonstration and testing.
2. **Public GitHub Repository**
    - Fission’s full source code is open-sourced on GitHub. We provide clear commit history, documentation, and instructions to run or extend the agent.
3. **Quantitative Benchmarks**
    - Fission includes an **LLM evaluation** framework (G-Eval) providing metrics like coherence, consistency, and comprehensiveness. We quantify improvements or performance changes across versions.
4. **Detailed Documentation**
    - Our repository contains a thorough **README**, code architecture diagrams, and usage instructions, along with a roadmap for future development.
5. **Video Demo**
    - A concise 3–5 minute demo shows how Fission’s agent processes data on NEAR, executes tasks, and logs its reasoning in real-time.
6. **Link to Deployed Agent**
    - We provide a direct link to the Fission AI Agent on [NEAR Agent Hub](https://app.near.ai/agents) so judges and community members can interact with it.

## Technical Overview

1. **Architecture**
    - **LLM Analysis**: Fission’s AI Decision Agent uses large language models (e.g., GPT-based or local open-source LLMs) to parse NEAR tasks and governance proposals.
    - **On-Chain Interaction**: NEAR contracts are invoked by the agent when specific conditions or confidence thresholds are met.
2. **Performance Benchmarking**
    - We use **G-Eval** to measure the agent’s decision quality under different scenarios. Both **simple** and **complex** tasks are assessed, ensuring reliability before on-chain actions.
3. **Tool Integration**
    - The agent can automatically call NEAR services, indexers, or oracles to fetch data, interpret it, and incorporate these insights into its decision logic.
4. **Security & Error Handling**
    - We implement an error-recovery protocol: if the agent encounters contradictory data or insufficient confidence, it will log the issue and optionally request human review.
