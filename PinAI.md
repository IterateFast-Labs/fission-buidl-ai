# Fission — PIN AI Track

This **PIN AI-focused** README details how **Fission** integrates with the [**PIN AI ecosystem**](https://www.pinai.io/) to deliver **personalized AI agent services**. Fission extends its **AI Decision Agent**, **benchmarking framework**, and **on-chain governance code** to work seamlessly with **PIN AI’s** unique emphasis on personal data, real-world service requests, and fully autonomous agent execution.

---

## Overview

**PIN AI** envisions a future where each individual has a **personal AI** that securely holds personal data, preferences, and behavioral patterns. Fission complements this mission by providing an **AI Decision Agent** capable of:

- **Personal Data-Driven Reasoning**
    
    Leverage user-specific data from the **PIN protocol** to offer hyper-personalized recommendations, decisions, and automated actions.
    
- **Autonomous Service Execution**
    
    Go beyond suggestions—place real orders (e.g., food delivery), book flights, or even manage financial tasks on behalf of the user’s personal AI.
    
- **Transparent Logging & Licensing**
    
    Provide easy-to-audit reasoning traces for each decision or transaction. Optionally integrate with an IP licensing framework if the agent’s outputs need ownership/monetization tracking.
    

By deploying on the **PIN Agent Registry** and connecting to user-specific endpoints, Fission ensures each AI agent can deliver specialized services—whether it’s travel planning, job matching, personalized shopping, or beyond.

## Key Features for PIN AI

1. **Personal Data Integration**
    - Fission’s agent retrieves **user profiles, preferences, and historical data** via the **PIN sandbox** or live environment.
    - This data shapes every step of the AI’s reasoning, ensuring each recommendation or action fits the user’s unique needs.
2. **Autonomous Task Flow**
    - Once the user’s personal AI requests a service (e.g., “book a trip to Tokyo,” “find me a new job in software engineering”), Fission’s agent executes multi-step tasks to fulfill the request:
        1. Summarize user requirements
        2. Compare possible solutions (flight options, job opportunities, products)
        3. Negotiate or finalize transactions (e.g., flight booking, job application flow)
        4. Send confirmation or fallback prompts
3. **On-Chain Registration**
    - The agent is registered in the **PIN AI Agent Registry** on **Base Sepolia**, meeting the requirement of being recognized as a valid service provider in the PIN marketplace.
4. **Interactive Sandbox & Marketplace**
    - We test interactions in a controlled environment provided by **PIN** (using [pinai_agent_sdk](https://pypi.org/project/pinai-agent-sdk/) and the [dev-guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mO0UuGliloJDW6ilLh8ragsQWO4gqHl6/view?usp=drive_link)) to ensure the agent can exchange relevant data, handle user prompts, and execute end-to-end flows.
    - We also connected PIN mcp agent kit with claude-desktop to test in depth analysis chatbot.

## How Fission Aligns with PIN AI Requirements

### A. Functionality (50%)

- **Fully Autonomous Flows**
    
    Fission’s agent covers the **entire user journey**, from reading personal data and preferences to concluding a real transaction (e.g., booking a flight, ordering food, scheduling events).
    
- **Confidence Thresholds**
    
    The agent logs chain-of-thought, includes fallback or re-check strategies if incomplete data is detected, and only finalizes a transaction when certain confidence or verification criteria are met.
    

### B. Registration (25%)

- **PIN AI Agent Registry**
    
    Fission’s AI Decision Agent is fully **registered on Base Sepolia** using [the agent registry contract](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xD2004b20B39A6b4397df87dadDaEFB0aEfe32089).
    
- **Public GitHub Repository**
    
    We provide our open-source code and instructions on how to replicate the registration process, ensuring compliance and transparency.
    

### C. Innovation (25%)

- **Personal Data Leverage**
    
    Our AI demonstrates how to incorporate **user-specific** data in real-time decisions, achieving a degree of personalization not possible with traditional AI.
    
- **Multi-Domain Use Cases**
    
    We showcase optional expansions: from an **AI Travel Agent** to an **AI Financial Advisor**, or even an **AI Dating Matchmaker**, illustrating broad real-world potential.

## Example Use Case

1. **Personal AI -> Travel Agent Request**
    - The user’s personal AI says, “Plan my next trip for a 5-day vacation in July to a budget-friendly beach destination.”
2. **Data Gathering**
    - Fission queries the user’s travel history, budget constraints, and lodging preferences from the PIN sandbox or marketplace environment.
3. **Intelligent Recommendation**
    - LLM-based reasoning filters flight/hotel deals, cross-references user’s preferences, and crafts an itinerary.
    - If a futarchy or cost aggregator is available, the agent factors in dynamic pricing or predicted price fluctuations.
4. **Autonomous Booking**
    - The agent prepares final booking details, confirms them with the user, and executes the on-chain transaction for purchasing flight tickets or lodging reservations (via third-party APIs or integrated protocols).
5. **Result & Logging**
    - The user receives a detailed itinerary plus a chain-of-thought log explaining how the agent arrived at that plan.
    - On-chain records confirm a successful transaction, with the agent’s usage documented in the PIN registry for future references or user reviews.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**
    - Allow different specialized Fission agents (finance, scheduling, therapy) to share data or chain-of-thought logs securely through the PIN AI platform.
2. **Automated Payment & Escrow**
    - Incorporate decentralized payment channels or stablecoins to handle agent or user transactions automatically, building user trust through **smart escrow**.
3. **Data Privacy & Consent**
    - Implement advanced user permissions: the agent only sees partial data unless the user explicitly grants access, respecting PIN AI’s privacy-first approach.
4. **Machine Learning Personalization**
    - Over time, the agent refines personalization models with user feedback, storing changes in preference settings on the agent registry.
